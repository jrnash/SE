--------- 
 1-Removed debug code that wrote to 'ERROR.LOG';
 2-Save system timers to *.SIM file & verify correct restoral
 3-System timers changed to be contiguous 1-5
 4-Enable loading a *.sim from command line

Ver 0.8b2 (Start: 1-21-96) (Froze: 1-24-96 18:30:00pm)                       
--------- 
 1-Fix Screen Saver code to NOT Display Graph when already in IOMode=1

Ver 0.8b1 (Start: 1-20-96) (Froze: 1-21-96 00:28:00 )                       
--------- Seems to work but may loose this version and continue with 0.8a4?
          Will probably move some events back to bug moves vs. systime?
          !===============================================================!
 1-Added condition to SaveSim,LoadSim & GetLogName for clean exit with <ESC> 
 2-Convert all System timers to use system clock, Added Several Functions
   changed all timer Variable names & structures.
 3-Cycle counter uses bug moves, not system timer 
  -Same needs to happen for Place Bacteria Timer since small pop (3 bugs)
   eat lots of bact per sec, compared to lots of bugs moving slower & bact count never gets above min. to support larger population.
N1-Graph Looks different with system timer of course.
P1-Need to ensure that all desired variable are loaded/retrieved to *.sim
P1-Warning: Operation off of system clock causes slower systems to have a
   substantially different feel to the Graph since graph displays less 
   bug moves per sec resulting in a higher resolution graph, THIS IS BAD!
                                                       
Ver 0.8a4 (Start: 1-20-96) (Froze: 1-20-96 18:00:00)

 1-Fixed v0.8a3-P1, in Display_Pause_Option
 2-Added code to Save/Load Graph Data, v0.8a3-P3 solved.
 3-Changed wGRAPHBuff to constant CGRAPHBuff = 3, Changes value will create load incompatibility across versions. 
 4-Removed call to Inti_Graph & code that zero'd wGRAPHCurs1 & 2 in LoadSim
   All data in a block occupies one line, separated by spaces

Ver 0.8a3 (Start: 1-16-96) (Froze: 1-17-96 22:14:00)                       
---------
 1-Finialize Proc LoadAll()!
 2-free all bug memory structures prior to loading new ones from file
 3-Converted Functions OnAnyBug() and In_Garden() from internal to external 
P1-Pause option has top line gray after use
P2-Loading TEST2.SIM causes beep, meaning bacteria count off?
P3-Graph initially displays all element as 0 after load.  Should not show any
   elements after a load, just as if program was started anew.
P4-Extranous test code in SE_IO LoadAll need to be removed

Ver 0.8a2 (Start 1-16-96) (Froze: 1-16-96 19:53:00)

P1-Timeout on Save Simulation menu option sometimes to quick!
P2-Boundry Alphanumeric characters not accepted by GetFName();
P3-Missing a <CR> between last bug and start of Bact in saved .SIM file.

Ver 0.7a9 (Started 1-14-96) (Froze: 1-15-96 16:46:00)                       
---------

 6-Changed screen timeout to 5000 bug moves (10 cycles ?)
 7-Chnged string var in SE_IO, Assign(Simfile) from RTP^.SimFile to FullFName
N1-Make sure the *.sim file you are trying to load is actually in your 
   working directory! (../temp)
P1-Noticed that during confirmation on load sim part of menu was wiped out.

Ver 0.7a7 (Started on 1-13-96) (Froze: 1-13-96 19:02:00)                       
---------
 1-User Interface polishing (Much!)
 2-Added Constants & Variables for Sim & Log files
 3-Changes procedure name from SimStatGP to SimStatUI (UserInput)
 4-Added Procedure GetFname which returns a Filename (snazzy!)
N1-Much undone work in SE_IO but I believe code to be stable for freeze
P1-Menu not restored after an Alt-L with no initial password & <CR> entered
   for password.
P2-If Garden dimensions maxed out then Garden turned off, bacteria count 
   on graph exceeds graph boundaries.
N2-During above testing - Unable to move garden dimensions back down. 
   Down arrow on menu item just caused a beep(?) (Garden was OFF, Duh!)
   
Ver 0.7a6 (Started on 1-13-96) (Froze: 1-13-96 13:17:00)                       
---------
 1-Added IO_B Menu including
   Save Simulation
   Load Simulation
   Logging        T/F
   Log Period     XX
   Max File Size  XX   No Time to test so unknown if bugs were introduced
 2-Added Right arrow key as option for moving to next menu
 3-Changed Initial credit display time to work off of system clock
 4-Fixed problem with Process_Key returning to graph mode when key struck
   While in a menu option that requires text input
 5-Changed Message timout to work off of system clock.  Done by adding
   Procedure WaitaSec() in SE_COM.

Ver 0.7a5 (FROZE 1-7-96 6:28pm) No known problems, Drift Cntr Enabled
--------
 1-Changed Functions CountAll & Count Garden back to return a Word
 2-Heavy modification of SE_IO.  Extended char is now stored in ExCh
   at begining of Proc Process_Key.  Password Functions also cleaned up.
 3-Removed Restore Defaults option from Menu options
 4-Modified GetNewPass to interpret "<CR>" as a Carriage Return

Ver 0.7a4 (FROZE 12-17-95 7:48pm) PROBLEM?-Test/Debug Code Enabled
--------
 1-Added code to Beep when down arrow key struck when at top of user menu.
 2-Added space at end of text constant Desc[12,1] in SE_COM to display "y". 
 3-Implemented code to adjust garden & screen count after manual changes
 4-Changed Functions CountAll & Count Garden to return Integer vs. Word
 5-Added Timer block 7 to calculate Drift (Only works when Garden ON)
N*-Note: This fixed problem 0.7a3.3 below until this timer removed
   Must remember to adjust NUMOFTIMER to correct value!
 6-Changed Display Drift Function to show Screen & Garden Drift
 7-Added Function ReCalc_Garden() in SE_MATH.  Required to recalculate all
   affected variables once Width or Hight changed.  Drift mostly fixed. 
 8-Added Function ModifyTF() in SE_IO to adjust Boolean values in Menu.  
 
N1-Have DRIFT problem even when NOT adjusting garden boundaries.  It MUST be 
   a round off error in SE_MATH or SE_GRAPH when determining if a bacteria
   is in or out of garden.  It mostly averages out so garden either has a
   few bacteria that belong to Screen or visa-versa.  Discrepancy becomes more pronounced when shrinking garden but could still be attributable to round off error. (Turning garden off/on will zero out drift temporarily)

N2-Suspect a problem in the count bacteria procedures because -/+ drift between screen becomes uneven for a while then evens back out?  Another
possible round off error when counting garden second time? (Pretty sure!)

Ver 0.7a3 FROZE (12-17-95)   Bug Fix (User Interface under construction)
--------
 1-Fixed Bug in SE_IO, Modify function, SetTextJustify to defaults at end.
 2-Fixed Bug in SE_IO, Process_Key function, Needed to set IOMode=1 before
   calling SSOff() procedure so as not to underrun the Desc. Array.
 3-Deleted procedure SSOff() as one line was redundant and other line moved
   to calling function.
 4-Fixed Bug in SE, Timers[5], Graph is now updated when screen saver on.  
N1-NUMOFTIMERS in SE_COM was 7 when only 6 timers were being used. (Problem?)

10-Function to display species data
                          123456789012345678
                          0:  _23/2.30   = 96 pixels

Ver 0.5h FROZE (5-23-94)       Garden Isolation
--------
1-Added code in proc that calculates next move and position to turn a bug that
  is moving vertically (Dir=0 or 3) towards the garden when the garden is on.
  VERTICALY MOVING BUGS NO LONGER STEAL FROM GARDEN!
2-changed bMAXBUGS to wMAXBUGS
3-Mutation Severity and Mutation Rate have a resolution of 255 by shifting
  the probability left or right on the number line.  This change was made in
  unit SE_BUG function "mutate".  4 random number are generated from 0 to
  range and then divided by 4 times range to produce low std-dev.
4-Tested mutation of MAX_AGE (Ok?)
5-Changed 'user = test' to 'User=restricted'
6-Changed code in SE_GRAPH to use same proc (Display_value)

Ver 0.5d  FROZE (1-8-93)    Slight Problem with garden boundries? (see 0.5e16)
--------
1  -All Variables in RTP Record have an added letter proceding the var
    name indicating type as follows:
         s : shortint         i : integer         l : longint
         b : byte             w : word            r : real
2  -Moved calculation of bGARDENLIM/bSCREENLIM in Calc_Defaults before
    calculation of GMAXATTEMPTS and SMAXATEMPTS since they use the value
    of bGARDENLIM/bSCREENLIM in their definition!
    (Solution of 1 potential run-time error)
3  -Moved OnAnyBug() function in SE_GRAPH out of Until loop so that the
    LL is not traversed unless all other conditions are met.
4  -Used Record Typecasting to insure that only variables of type Real
    are passed to Func Trunc() and result of func. Trunc() is only
    assigned to type of LongInt.
5  -Changed all color variables to type word.  Changed most integer
    types to type word.
6  -Used Record Typecasting to insure that all formulas include
    only variable types that will give desired value.
7  -Used Record Typecasting to insure that all assignments return same
    type as L-Value variable.
8  -!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    FIXED LOCKUP !!!! RTP is NOW assigned a value prior to Set_Defaults()!
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9  -Fixed problem with formula for RTP^.wGARDNEARX/Y
10 -Fixed problem with runaway bact count (induced by changing variables
    Add_to_Screen and Add_to_Garden to type Word in Populate..() functions)
    by setting values to 0 if Bact.. count > wMAXBACT..
11 -Changed Bug^.age type to Word and header/trailer node value to ($FFFF)

Ver 0.5c FROZE (1-1-93) HAS RUNTIME ERROR (See Ver 0.5d for fix)
--------
1  -Moved function Set_Defaults(RTP) into SE_MATH
2  -Moved all formulas in Set_Defaults into function Calc_Defaults(RTP)
3  -Make Garden bacteria line up with screen grid
4  -Move Timer procedure into SE.PAS

Ver 0.5b FROZE (12-31-92) HAS RUNTIME ERROR (See Ver 0.5d for fix)
--------
1  -Added Function Display_Screen; that draws border rectangle and
    fills area with BACK_COL
2  -Renamed Procedure Blank_Coord to Color_Rectangle (used above)
3  -Changed way bacteria deposited to include MAXX/MAXY limits.
4  -Changed formulas in SE_MATH/SE_GRAPH for bugs to be wrapped to
    inclued new MAXX/MAXY limits, dimension now MAX?-MAX?+1.
5  -Note: Calculated Values
        Bug Record = 63 Bytes
        Minimum memory in heap for graphics drivers = 9616 Bytes
        Minimum required memory = 9616 + (63 * MAXBUGS)
    Compilation with MinHeap set to 32K combined with cap on MAXBUGS
    should eliminate risk of out of mem Error at runtime.
6  -Changed SE_Error functions to use RTP fields instead of static vars.
    Also, Error text is embeded in WriteError function with case statement.
7  -Logic Errors in function Child_Bug; were corrected.  Possible
    access of array beyond boundries!
8  -Used Type casting in SE_COM function Set_Defaults to assign longint to
    type integer;
9  -Added two fields to RTP, SCREENLIMPCT, GARDENLIMPCT for to be used for
    calculating SCREENLIM and GARDENLIM.  ALSO changed SDENSITY and GDENSITY
    to hold 1.2% as value 1.20 instead of 0.012.
10 -Using Turbo Pascal 6.0 instead of 5.5!
11 -typcasting intermediate results in SE_COM. exmpl:
    RealTemp      := GARDWID * GARDHIG * GDensity * 0.01;
    LongTemp      := Trunc(RealTemp);
    Instead of calculating 1st formula inside Trunc function!
12 -Fixed logic error in SE_GRAPH, Populate_Screen & Populate_Garden
    Need to check for excessive attempts value in Until statement.
    Could also be fixed by doing complete Boolean evaluation instead of
    short circuit? (I hope)
13 -For successful execution from inside compiler the following options were
    set  (286,Full Boolean evaluaton,MinHeap=32768,MaxHeap=32768)

Ver 0.5a FROZE (12-26-92) HAS RUNTIME ERROR (See Ver 0.5d for fix)
--------
1  -Placed most constants in the record RTP (SE_COM) to which a pointer
    is passed all over hell as apposed to making them global variables.
2  -Added function Set_Defaults to SE_COM
3  -All non-integers are type real because type single requires 80x87.
4  -Moved Function WaitForAnykey to SE_TEST.
5  -Note (TURBO.TP file set for MinHeap = 32K/MaxHeap = 64K)

Ver 0.4f FROZE (12-25-92)   No Known Errors
--------
1  -Added Function OnAnyBug to determine if chosen coordinates for
    placement of a bacteria are on the body of any bugs. (DRIFT FIXED!)
2  -Fixed Creat_Bugs so that MinX/MinY are used
3  -Added Color constant BC_Vry_O (DarkGray) for very old bugs.
4  -Fixed Display of Statistics on right so that all is right justified.
    Procedures Display_Bug, Bact, etc. in SE_GRAPH

--------
1  -Move all test functions to test unit
2  -Problem in the way bacteria drift calculated resolved
3  -Changed graphics formulas for constants to inclued MinX/MinY
4  -Probelm in the way constant GARDFARY calculated resolved.
5  -Moved Triggers for Timer block from SE_COM to SE_TIMER
6  -When < minimum # of bugs occures, new genes are calc'd for bug.
7  -Code Added to SE_BUG to catch Gene values that would cause floating
    point overflow.  Still need code to handle recovery or explain error.
8  -Changed 6 bug genes to reside in an array to reduce code size
9  -Added unit SE_ERROR to store runtime errors, halt execution
    and display runtime errors if they occur.

Ver 0.4d FROZE (12-9-92)
--------
1  -Added function Display_all_of so that a "portion" of a bug is never
    displayed on the screen and a bacteria can never be placed in the
    space that a bug is supposed to exist.  Clears up all Bact Drift?

Ver 0.4c  FROZE (12-7-92)
--------
1  -Reworked Main; Procedures CheckforFood and Move combined into
    Search_For_Food.  Header/Trailer Node in LL now indicated by dir= -1
2  -Procedure Remove changed to Erase_Previous_Pos and overwrites only
    over Bug pixels that will not be part of Bugs new position.
3  -The way MaxX and MaxY borders are handled changed
4  -When displaying bug in new position only changed pixels are written
    (see item 2 above)
6  -Fixed logic in SE_IO.PAS that differentiated between Screen Count and
    Garden Count when Garden state changed.
5  -Evidence that "minute" Bacteria Drift still exists.  This seems to
    occur in function Erase_Previous_Pos?

Ver 0.4b  FROZE (12-3-92)
--------
1  -Changed method bacteria is deposited in garden.  It is now similar to
    rest of screen (Major Graphics revamp!)
2  -Changed bact deposit code so that bact does not land on bugs.
3  -Changed bug check for food so as not to search bug pixels for bact.

Ver 0.4a  FROZE (12-2-92)
--------
1  -Fixed Problem with major bacteria drift.  Minor drift still exists.
    Problem was in initial FOR loop index being a 0 instead of 1!
2  -Fixed pixel overwrite problem (Bacteria)
3  -Added Function BCount which actually counts Bact_col pixels on screen.
    Function Places a pixel of Wait_col at bottom right of screen
    Timer calls Function every 5th generation to account for bact drift.
    Will be removed once source of problem is found.
4  -Modified Place_Bact so that the garden is done with a separate func.
5  -Modified BUG_COM.PAS for running on a monochrome system with small VGA.
6  -Added function Wait_for_anykey in IO_PAS that does just that.
7  -Increased range for initial gene variables in Create_But from 3 to 5
8  -Used Automatic variable in Calc_Prob(New_Bug) to make more efficient
9  -Changed CONSTANTS to represent those mentioned in initial SE article
10 -Changed min bact to 2 and max bact to 65
11 -Made se_com.pas into two files (*.col, *.mon) to compile for color
    VGA and monochrome (specificaly the DA-30 gas plasma display). Also
    made bat files to help prep for seperate compilations.

1  -Added Color to Bugs

Ver 0.1c
--------
1  -Item 2 of 0.1b addressed by not dec Bact_Num if bug in garden
2  -Garden density lowered to 1/16
3  -Item 4 of 0.1b addressed by correcting offset formulas
4  -Dead Bugs now decompose into 9 bact instead of disappearing
5  -Item 6 of 0.1a caused problem, fixed by allways adding bact if garden on
6  -CONST in BUG_COM.PAS changed
7  -Lowest level main loop determined by BactRateDivisor instead of "10"

Ver 0.1b  FROZE
--------
1  -Garden of Eden implemented with the DrawPoly() proc at Refresh_Rate
2  -Bacteria eaten in garden not counted, causing major drift in Bact_Num
3  -Garden density determined by CONST in GRAPHICS.PAS (50%)
4  -Garden not centered in screen, offset problem
5  -Alt-G does not clear garden until next refresh, can be length delay

Ver 0.1a  FROZE
--------
1  -Garden of Eden made by higher % bact deposit
2  -All graphic offsets calculated from MaxX/MaxY CONST's
3  -Copyright displayed on intro
4  -User control Keys include Alt-P, Alt-G, and Alt-X
5  -File EGAVGA.BGI file now required in C:\TP directory
6  -Bact Replenishment operates as a Schmitt Trigger on two thresholds
7  -Procedure Calc_Offsets created that will be replaced by CONST dec's
8  -Spelling errors in source code comments
9  -Accuracy of Bact_Num can drift quickly because of pixel overwrites
10 -Screen Refreshed at Refresh_Rate to reset Bact_Num counter
11 -Initialize of bugs made into a procedure
